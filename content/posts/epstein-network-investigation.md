The investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's network of enablers is continuing, but progress has been slow. More than six years after Epstein's death, only a handful of his alleged co-conspirators have been charged with crimes.

The slow pace of the investigation has been a source of frustration for many of Epstein's victims, who have been waiting for years to see all of those who facilitated his crimes brought to justice.

"It's like they're not even trying," said one victim, who asked to remain anonymous. "They're so focused on the big names that they're letting the little guys get away with it."

The Department of Justice has defended its handling of the investigation, saying that it is committed to bringing all of those who were involved in Epstein's crimes to justice. However, the department has also acknowledged that the investigation is complex and that it will take time to build strong cases against all of the potential targets.

The investigation is further complicated by the fact that many of the potential targets are wealthy and powerful individuals with close ties to the political and financial elite. This has led to accusations that the investigation is being hampered by political pressure.

The Department of Justice has denied these allegations, but it has been unable to shake the perception that it is not doing enough to bring all of those who were involved in Epstein's crimes to justice.
