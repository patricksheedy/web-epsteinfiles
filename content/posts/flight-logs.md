# Uncovering Connections: The Epstein Flight Logs

The flight logs from Jeffrey Epstein's private jets, most notably the Boeing 727 often referred to as the "Lolita Express," are critical pieces of evidence that provide insight into the network of individuals connected to him. These logs document numerous flights to various destinations, including his private island, Little St. James, in the U.S. Virgin Islands.

## What the Flight Logs Reveal

The logs contain lists of passengers who traveled with Epstein over the years. While the presence of a name on a flight log is not, by itself, proof of wrongdoing, the lists include a wide array of powerful and influential people, including:

- Politicians and world leaders
- Royalty
- Business executives and billionaires
- Celebrities from the film and fashion industries
- Academics and scientists

The frequency of travel and the list of fellow passengers have been central to investigations and public scrutiny.
