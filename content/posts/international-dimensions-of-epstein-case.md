The Jeffrey Epstein scandal has long been an international affair, with the disgraced financier's network of powerful associates spanning the globe. In recent months, the international dimensions of the case have come into sharper focus, with new investigations and political fallout in France and the UK.

In France, prosecutors have been investigating Epstein's ties to the country for several years. The investigation has focused on allegations that Epstein procured young women and girls for his powerful friends in France, and that he used his connections to the French elite to protect himself from scrutiny.

The investigation has been a source of major controversy in France, with some accusing the government of trying to cover up the extent of Epstein's crimes. The government has denied these allegations, but it has been unable to shake the perception that it is not doing enough to bring all of those who were involved in Epstein's crimes to justice.

In the UK, the Epstein scandal has been a major headache for the royal family, which has been struggling to contain the damage from Prince Andrew's friendship with the disgraced financier. The prince has been accused of sexually assaulting one of Epstein's victims, and he has been forced to step back from his royal duties.

The Epstein scandal has also had a major impact on the world of finance, with several major banks facing scrutiny over their ties to the disgraced financier. The scandal has been a wake-up call for the financial industry, which has been forced to confront its own role in enabling Epstein's crimes.

The international dimensions of the Epstein case are a reminder that this is a story that is far from over. It is a story that will continue to unfold in the months and years to come, and it is a story that will have a lasting impact on the worlds of politics, finance, and royalty.
