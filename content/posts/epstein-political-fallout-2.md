The political fallout from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal has intensified in recent days, with both Republicans and Democrats facing renewed scrutiny over their ties to the disgraced financier. The controversy has become a major headache for the Republican party, which is struggling to contain the damage from the revelation that former President Donald Trump's name appears in the Epstein files.

Two Republican lawmakers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told Reuters that they are concerned that the Epstein furor is undermining public trust in the party and could hurt their chances in the upcoming midterm elections. "This is a disaster," said one of the lawmakers. "We're trying to focus on the issues that matter to voters, but all anyone wants to talk about is Epstein."

The White House has been forced to repeatedly deny that Trump was involved in any wrongdoing, but the story has refused to go away. The former president has been uncharacteristically quiet on the issue, which has only fueled speculation about what he might know.

Meanwhile, Democrats have been using the Epstein scandal to attack their Republican opponents, with some calling for a full investigation into Trump's relationship with the financier. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said that the Epstein case is "not a hoax" and that he is open to a congressional inquiry.

The political maneuvering is a sign of the deep divisions in Washington and the extent to which the Epstein scandal has become a partisan issue. It is also a reminder of the long shadow that the case continues to cast over American politics.
