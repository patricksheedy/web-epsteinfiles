## A Desert Oasis with a Dark Side

In addition to his homes in New York, Palm Beach, and Paris, and his private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Jeffrey Epstein also owned a sprawling, 10,000-acre ranch in New Mexico. The Zorro Ranch, as it is known, is a remote and secluded property located in the high desert near the town of Stanley.

## The Property

The Zorro Ranch is a world unto itself. It includes a massive main residence, a number of guest houses, an airplane hangar, and a private airstrip. The property is also home to a number of strange and unusual features, including a "cowboy town" with a saloon and a blacksmith shop, and a series of underground tunnels that connect the various buildings.

The ranch was a place where Epstein could escape from the world and indulge his fantasies. It was a place where he could entertain his powerful friends and associates, and where he could allegedly carry out his crimes far from the prying eyes of the law.

## The Allegations

The allegations surrounding the Zorro Ranch are similar to those surrounding Epstein's other properties. Victims have described being flown to the ranch on Epstein's private jet and being forced to participate in sexual acts with Epstein and his guests. They have spoken of a culture of fear and intimidation, and of being trapped in a remote and isolated location with no way to escape.

The Zorro Ranch was allegedly a key part of Epstein's sex trafficking operation. It was a place where he could bring his victims, and where he could introduce them to his powerful friends and associates. It was a place where he could operate with impunity, and where he could be sure that his secrets would be safe.

## The Investigation

After Epstein's death, the Zorro Ranch became a focus of the investigation. The FBI raided the property, seizing computers, documents, and other evidence. The contents of those seizures have not been made public, but they are believed to be a crucial part of the ongoing investigation into Epstein's network.

The Zorro Ranch is a chilling reminder of the scope and scale of Epstein's criminal enterprise. It is a testament to his ability to create a world where he could operate above the law, and where he could indulge his darkest fantasies without fear of being held accountable. The full story of what happened at the Zorro Ranch may never be known, but one thing is certain: it is a story that is far from over.
