**WASHINGTON** - The ghost of Jeffrey Epstein continues to haunt the halls of power in Washington, with two U.S. lawmakers warning that the ongoing controversy could severely damage public trust in the Trump administration and jeopardize Republican chances in the 2026 midterm elections. The remarks, made on Sunday, highlight the growing political fallout from the handling of the deceased financier and sex offender's case.

In a rare display of bipartisanship, Republican Representative Thomas Massie and Democratic Representative Ro Khanna have joined forces to demand transparency. They are championing a resolution that would compel the full release of all government files related to the Epstein investigation. Their concern, as articulated on NBC's "Meet the Press," is that the continued secrecy is cementing a dangerous public perception: that the wealthy and powerful are immune to the consequences of their actions.

"This is going to hurt Republicans in the midterms," Massie, a conservative from Kentucky, stated bluntly. "The voters will be apathetic if we don't hold the rich and powerful accountable."

The sentiment reflects a growing anxiety within the GOP that the Epstein issue could demotivate their base and alienate independent voters who are already skeptical of the justice system's impartiality. With slim majorities in both the House and Senate, the Republican party can ill-afford any erosion of voter confidence.

Adding fuel to the fire are the actions of Attorney General Pam Bondi. According to Representative Khanna, Bondi has created a "crisis of trust" with her conflicting statements. After initially suggesting the existence of a list of Epstein's high-profile clients, she later reversed her position, claiming no such list exists. This reversal has ignited a firestorm of criticism, particularly from President Trump's own MAGA base, with many calling for her resignation.

"This is about trust in government," Khanna, a Democrat from California, emphasized. "This is about being a reform agent of transparency."

The controversy has followed President Donald Trump across the Atlantic. While in Scotland for a trip that combines golf with trade negotiations, the President has reportedly been frustrated by the persistent questions surrounding his administration's management of the Epstein files.

The push for transparency faces significant hurdles. House Speaker Mike Johnson has so far resisted calls for a vote on the Massie-Khanna resolution. Instead, he has backed a non-binding alternative that calls for the release of only "credible" evidence, citing the need to protect victims, including minors.

Massie and Khanna have dismissed this as a "straw man" argument, insisting their legislation is carefully drafted to redact the names of victims. "They're hiding behind that," Massie asserted.

The political maneuvering in Washington does little to quell the public's demand for answers. The Epstein case, with its sordid details of sexual abuse and its entanglement with a global elite of politicians, businessmen, and even royalty, has become a symbol of a justice system that many believe is broken. As the 2026 midterms approach, the handling of this sensitive issue may well become a defining test of political accountability.
