## A Friendship of Convenience

Like many powerful men in New York and Palm Beach, Donald Trump was a friend of Jeffrey Epstein. The two men were often seen together at parties and at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in the 1990s and early 2000s.

## The Nature of the Friendship

The nature of their friendship has been the subject of some debate. Trump has said that he was never a "fan" of Epstein, and he has claimed that he had a falling out with him years ago. However, in a 2002 interview with New York Magazine, Trump said that Epstein was a "terrific guy" and that he was a "lot of fun to be with."

## The Allegations

Trump has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with the Epstein case. However, his friendship with Epstein has been a source of controversy, and it has been used by his political opponents to attack him.

One of the most serious allegations against Trump comes from a woman who claims that she was raped by Trump and Epstein at a party in 1994. The woman, who filed a lawsuit against Trump in 2016, later dropped the suit.

## The Aftermath

The Trump-Epstein friendship has been a recurring theme in the media's coverage of the Epstein case. It has been used to raise questions about Trump's judgment and character, and it has been used to suggest that he is part of a larger culture of sexual abuse and exploitation.

The story of the Trump-Epstein friendship is a reminder that the world of the rich and powerful is a small one, and that it is a world where people from all walks of life can come together. It is also a reminder that the past can never be fully erased, and that the choices we make can come back to haunt us in unexpected ways.
